### Changing the position and size

- The whole overlay is a Control node so you can adjust its width in the inspector under `Rect > Min Size`.
  + Default is 300 pixels wide.
- If you prefer it to be on the right side of the screen, select the `Monitor Overlay` node, click on `Layout > Right Wide`.
- To change the vertical size of the graphs, adjust the `Graph Height` properties in the inspector.


## Important note
- The overlay is a 2D node that contains other nodes (one for each graph). Because of this, the reported amount of
objects / nodes / memory used and others will differ if the overlay is enabled or not. While the difference is not
significant, keep in mind that it exists.
- Plotting a graph requires to keep track of the values history and can impact performance.
  + If you don't need this feature, you can turn it off by disabling the `Plot Graphs` option in the inspector.
  + Lowering the `History` parameter also helps.
